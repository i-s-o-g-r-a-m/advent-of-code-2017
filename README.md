# Advent of Code 2017

It's well into 2018 and I'm still chipping away. I sure hope to finish by the time
the 2018 edition arrives.

Languages used so far:
* ClojureScript (via planck)
* Elixir
* Elm
* Python

Observations:
* Elm's compiler is still a lot of fun to use.
* `planck` makes ClojureScript easy and fun, I really enjoyed using it.
* Elixir, well, I'm somewhat equivocal on, though it has some cool stuff, and the docs are quite good. I'm going to do more of it.
* Having automatic code formatting (as you do with Elm and now Elixir), especially when it is integrated into your editor on save, is so great.
* When the going gets tough, and because I'm trying to solve the problems as fast as possible, my brain reaches for Python. It seems like I can brute-force a solution in heavily-imperative Python when other avenues are failing me. This is a bit disappointing and not at all surprising. I still like Python and still think it's probably the best choice for beginners.
* I really do like functional programming. Going back to clumsy and impure styles of OO feels bad after immersing oneself in languages that encourage functional approaches.

Other languages to consider in the future:
* Go
* Kotlin
* C
* OCaml
* Swift
* Coconut
